    "\n",
    "So you know the basics of individual instructions and that a program is just a series of instructions. But the real strength of programming isn’t just running (or executing) one instruction after another. Based on how the expressions evaluate, the program can decide to skip instructions, repeat them, or choose one of several instructions to run. \n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, you almost never want your programs to start from the first line of code and simply execute every line, straight to the end. **Flow control** statements can decide which Python instructions to execute under which conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "These flow control statements directly correspond to the symbols in a flowchart, so we’ll provide flowchart versions of the code discussed in this chapter. Figure below shows a flowchart for what to do if your alarm rings in the morning. Follow the path made by the arrows from *Start* to *End*.\n",

Flowcharts represent these branching points with *diamonds*, while the other steps are represented with *rectangles*. The starting and ending steps are represented with *oval*.\n",
    "\n",
    "But before you learn about flow control statements, you first need to learn how to represent those *yes* and *no* options, and you need to understand how to write those branching points as Python code. To that end, let’s explore *Boolean values*, *comparison operators*, and *Boolean operators*."
