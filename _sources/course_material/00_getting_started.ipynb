    "\n",
    "Python course covers basic Python programming concepts. Here’s a brief rundown of what you’ll learn in this course:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Expressions** - The most basic type of Python instruction.\n",
    "- **Flow Control** - Make programs decide which instructions to execute so your code can respond to different conditions.\n",
    "- **Functions** - Organize your code into more manageable chunks using functions.\n",
    "- **Built-in Data Structures** - Use lists, tuples, dictionaries and sets to manage your data better.\n",
    "- **Comprehensions and Iterators** - Write super concise code.\n",
    "- **Exception handling** - Don't be afraid of errors instead handle them better.\n",
    "- **Strings and Regex** - Find patterns in text.\n",
    "- **Files** - Read & write data to persistent storage.\n",
    "- **Object Oriented Programming (OOPs)** - Use classes and objects to write reuseable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn and understand all the concepts better, you will be developing games and building projects, throughout the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "This is a demo of Python course, there is much more to offer you in complete python course.  \n",

    "## Python Programming Language\n",
    "\n",
    "In this data-driven age, Python has become an essential tool for many programmers, engineers, researchers, and data scientists across academia and industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being an AI start-up focused on building and promoting the Machine Learning and Data Science, we have found Python to be a near-perfect fit for the types of problems we face day to day, whether it's developing small web-apps, extracting meaning from large datasets, scraping and munging data collected from the Web, or automating day-to-day tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The appeal of Python is in its *simplicity* and *beauty*, as well as the convenience of the *large ecosystem* of domain-specific tools that have been built on top of it.\n",
    "For example, most of the Python code in scientific computing and data science is built around a group of mature and useful packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [NumPy](http://numpy.org) provides efficient storage and computation for multi-dimensional data arrays.\n",
    "- [SciPy](http://scipy.org) contains a wide array of numerical tools such as numerical integration and interpolation.\n",
    "- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org) provides a DataFrame object along with a powerful set of methods to manipulate, filter, group, and transform data.\n",
    "- [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org) provides a useful interface for creation of publication-quality plots and figures.\n",
    "- [Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org) provides a uniform toolkit for applying common machine learning algorithms to data.\n",
    "- [IPython/Jupyter](http://jupyter.org) provides an enhanced terminal and an interactive notebook environment that is useful for exploratory analysis, as well as creation of interactive, executable documents. For example, this course was developed entirely using Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "No less important are the numerous other tools and packages which accompany these: if there is a scientific or data analysis task you want to perform, chances are someone has written a package that will do it for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "To tap into the power of this data science ecosystem, however, first requires familiarity with the Python language itself. Our aim, with this course, is that students will walk away with a solid foundation about python and programming (in general)."

    "\n",
    "Anaconda is the standard platform for Python, Data Science, and open-source machine learning. [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) includes both Python and `conda`, and additionally bundles a suite of other pre-installed packages geared toward scientific computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a programming language, and `conda` is free & open-source package manager, which makes package management and deployment simpler. Just like *Play store* in android phones (or *App store* in iphones).\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine Anaconda as a tool that has multiple subtools like **Jupyter Notebook**, **JupyterLab**, **Spyder**. Just like MS-Office, it has subtools such as MS-Word, MS-Excel, MS-PowerPoint, etc."

    "\n",
    "For programming newbies, installing python, choosing the right IDE, installing data science libraries, etc can be a daunting task. Not just installation, knowing all the packages needed for data science (and their versions) is another challenge. That is where Anaconda comes into the picture. Anaconda automated the complete process. So that beginners can focus on learning."

    "\n",
    "After you visit the website, click on *download* button. You might see something like below.\n",
    "\n",

    "You must choose according to your system (**Linux**, **Windows**, **Mac**). You can download the installer for **Python 3.8** (latest version at the time of writing). And you can download it for a 32-bit or 64-bit machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../images/anaconda_version.png)\n",

    "#### 4. Add Anaconda to your PATH\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you’ll get some advanced options. Add Anaconda to your system’s **PATH environment variable**, and register it as the primary system **Python 3.8**. If you add it to PATH, it will be found before any other installation(It is not recommended but from my experience, we would recommend doing so, if not you will face problems in the future while installing some libraries). Click on *Install*. It takes a few minutes to install.\n",
